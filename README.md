# Salary-Calculator
The TechPro Salary Calculator Java program is designed to assist in managing employee salary information for a fictitious company (TechPro). 
It begins by welcoming the user and prompts for input regarding the hourly rate and weekly work hours for each of the five employees: Alice, Bob, Carl, Synthia, and Zudy. Subsequently, the program calculates and displays the weekly salary for each employee, followed by the total salary expense for TechPro, the average weekly salary, and information about the highest and lowest earners. The code utilizes arrays to store employee names and various salary-related data, employing loops for input and iterative calculations. Clear comments are embedded throughout the code, providing insightful explanations for each section, thereby facilitating comprehension for users or future developers examining the codebase.
